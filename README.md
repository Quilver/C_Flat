# C_Flat
A c# interpreter/transpiler for our general purpose programming language with a WPF GUI

## Getting Started

### Clone github repository and open in your IDE of choice (I'm going with JetBrains Rider)

To clone the repository, you can run the command below from a shell window (e.g. cmd or git bash) to clone the repository.
If you don't have git installed you can follow this guide: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

```sh
git clone git@github.com:UEA-advanced-programmers/C_Flat.git
```

If you opt to use Github Desktop instead you can do so:
Go to the repository page, click 'Code' -> 'Open with GitHub desktop' -> clone

Once you've cloned the rpeository, you should be able to open the project in your IDE of choice.

## Testing

This project will be using NUnit as a testing framework. You can run these from within your IDE using the testing window. To do this in Rider:
CLick "Unit Tests" at the bottom of the IDE window or press `Alt+Shift+8`.
